# Propositional Logic

Aim: - To implement Propositional Logic in AI using Python.

Propositional logic (PL) is the simplest form of logic where all the statements are made by propositions. A proposition is a declarative statement which is either true or false. It is a technique of knowledge representation in logical and mathematical form.

* Propositional logic is also called Boolean logic as it works on 0 and 1.
* In propositional logic, we use symbolic variables to represent the logic, and we can use any symbol for a representing a proposition, such A, B, C, P, Q, R, etc.
* Propositions can be either true or false, but it cannot be both.
* Propositional logic consists of an object, relations or function, and logical connectives.
* These connectives are also called logical operators.
* The propositions and connectives are the basic elements of the propositional logic.
